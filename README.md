## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project made me work a lot on flex and responsiveness. Also made me realize that in some cases less is more. Keeping your code simple and adding complexity as need, not the other way around.

### Continued development

This project made me realize on my progress. I could solve some issues but I still find trouble making my content responsive. That's something I going to work on.

### Useful resources

StackOverflow and W3School, as always. :D
